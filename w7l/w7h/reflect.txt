
1. Functions are used to break complex and long programs into small modules which can be upgraded with ease and contains readable amount of code and also reusable.
2. If we need to return more than one value from the function we can use a pointer which changes the formal argument with the address and the function returns nothing.
3. When a variable is declared within a function is called a local scope. The meaning of that variable ends after we close the end brace of the function.
When a variable is declared outside all functions definitions has global scope. Any program instruction can access that variable.
